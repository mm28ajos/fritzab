# FritzAB2Matrix

A script that reads out the answering machine of a FritzBox in the LAN and posts the messages into an encrypted private chat of the matrix network.


Uses the python based cmd-line-tool [matrix-commander](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander) so the matrix-commander.py in this repo is just a copy of that file to ease testing.
